# Self Portrait Assignment

## Chinonyerem Ukaegbu

**Description**

The task was to create a self portrait using Processing in order to practice using the drawing functions we had learnt in class

**Process**

Because I couldn't make the portrait exceedingly complex, I opted to include subtle elements that were a representation of myself in the portrait.
