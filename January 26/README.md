# Self Portrait Assignment

## Chinonyerem Ukaegbu

**Description**

The task was to create a self portrait using Processing in order to practice using the drawing functions we had learnt in class

**Process**

Because I couldn't make the portrait exceedingly complex, I opted to include subtle elements that were a representation of myself in the portrait.

I set the dimensions of the display window as 1000x800 because I wanted it to be a landscape setting. I also filled the background in with a dark blue colour to represent the night sky.

I then included little circles to represent the stars in the sky and outlined them in a colour a few shades darker than the fill colour.

After I was through with the background, I got to work on the head which is an ellipse and I outlined the head as well.
