# Generative Text Assignment - *Call It What You Want*

## Chinonyerem Ukaegbu


**Description**

The task was to create either a data visualization or a generative text using the functions we had learnt last class.

**Inspiration**

As you probably can tell from the contents of the data set, this project was heavily inspired by Taylor Swift. In honour of the announcement she made of the anticipated release of the rerecorded versions of the songs from her album *Fearless* , I decided to base this project off the lyrics of some of her earlier songs. The visualization is titled *Call It What You Want* partly because I had no idea what to call it and also because it's a reference to a song from her album *Reputation*. 

**Process**

There were a couple of datasets with the song lyrics separated by line number, but I needed the lyrics to be represented by one value per song entry, and then I came upon the data set accessible through this link:
[Taylor Swift Dataset](https://github.com/rochelleterman/FSUtext/blob/master/02_Dictionary/taylor_swift.csv)

</br>
I needed to count the number of characters per song lyric so I first had to download the CSV file, load it up in Excel, remove the forward slashes(/) that had been used to separate each line and then use an excel formula to calculate the number of characters in each song lyric entry.
