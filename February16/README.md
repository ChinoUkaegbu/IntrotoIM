# Generative Text Assignment - *Call It What You Want*

## Chinonyerem Ukaegbu


**Description**

The task was to create either a data visualization or a generative text using the functions we had learnt last class.

**Inspiration**

As you probably can tell from the contents of the data set, this project was heavily inspired by Taylor Swift. In honour of the announcement she made of the anticipated release of the rerecorded versions of the songs from her album *Fearless* , I decided to base this project off the lyrics of some of her earlier songs. The visualization is titled *Call It What You Want* partly because I had no idea what to call it and also because it's a reference to a song from her album *Reputation*.
