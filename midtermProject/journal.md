### Additional (after Minimum VP)
+ Day and night mode: after say 20 mouse clicks, keypresses, whatever, background changes from day to night
+ But would the images on top of it continue the same?
+ Think setup() or draw()?

### February 22
+ Uploaded background as image this time
+ A bit confused about where I would put the background(either setup or draw)
+ Put it in setup() at first and got this:

![Setup()Error](imagesTrials/Screenshot%20(224).png)

+ Realized my mistake and moved it to draw(). I also found out that writing the code for the background after the code for the ball would result in the ball being covered by the background instead of drawing over the background so that was really cool.
