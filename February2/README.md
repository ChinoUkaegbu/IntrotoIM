# Artwork Assignment

## Chinonyerem Ukaegbu


**Description**

The task was to create an art work using Processing in order to practice using the drawing functions we had learnt in class

**Inspiration**

I had no idea what I wanted to create prior to running the software. While Processing was loading and while I was thinking of what to design, Jon Bellion's *Woodstock(Psychedelic Fiction)* came up on my playlist and while listening to it, I looked up the meaning of the word "psychedelic" and found this definition:

*of or noting a mental state characterized by a profound sense of intensified sensory perception, sometimes accompanied by severe perceptual distortion and hallucinations and by extreme feelings of either euphoria or despair.*


It sounded really cool so I decided to base my artwork off of what I thought one would picture in a psychedelic state which is responsible for the symmetric patterns, weird colours and shifting shapes present in the design.

**Process**

* I set the canvas to a square shape with 800x800 dimensions and used the loop to create multiple squares all originating from a square in the top left corner. I also defined a line that passed through diagonals of all the squares, for aesthetic purposes.

* I then drew two circles with each circle having a concentric circle within it.

* Then, I drew two arcs at the top left and bottom right corners of the canvas.

* Then, I three triangles equally spaced right angled triangles with hypotenuses along the diagonal line of canvas and created a reflection of these triangles along that line.
