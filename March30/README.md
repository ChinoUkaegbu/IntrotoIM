When you press a button down, it may not immediately make a complete connection. In fact, it may make contact on one side – then both – and then the other side – until it finally settles down.
This making and breaking contact is called bouncing. It is not a manufacturing defect of the button – bouncing is implicit in most physical switches.

Arduino has an analogRead range from 0 to 1023, and an analogWrite range only from 0 to 255
