# Final Project Proposal

## Chinonyerem

**Description**

For my final project, I'd like to continue the idea from Piano Player, the game I created for Tuesday's project.
The current version is limited and has only one song but I plan on adding more functionality, particularly:
+ creating more modes for the user to play in. The current mode is called the *Learning Mode* because the user is not allowed to progress to the next note until they have mastered the note before. But in the *Expert Mode*, the user will play the tune at one go and signify that they are done by pushing a button. If they are correct, they get to advance, but if not, they have to restart the entire level.
