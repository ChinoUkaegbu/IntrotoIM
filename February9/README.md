# Game Assignment - *Boundaries*

## Chinonyerem Ukaegbu


**Description**

The task was to create an art work or game using Processing in order to practice using the functions and objects we had learnt last class

**Inspiration**

I'm a big fan of puzzles - sudoku, crosswords, jigsaws, and the game I created was heavily inspired by mazes except instead of dead ends signifying the end of the game, touching the walls signified the end.

**Process**

* I set the canvas to 1200x800 dimension in order to get a landscape orientation and set the background colour.
